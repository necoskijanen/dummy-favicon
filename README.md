# Dummy Favicon

## 1. Purpose (Why this file exists)

This `favicon.ico` file serves as a **placeholder** to prevent unnecessary HTTP 404 errors during development.

In local development environments, browsers automatically request `/favicon.ico`.
Without this file, a **404 Not Found** error is logged repeatedly, cluttering the console.

This transparent, minimal file ensures the browser receives a **200 OK** response, keeping the console output clean while a production favicon is being designed.

## 2. File Details

* **Filename:** `favicon.ico`
* **Content:** A single 1x1 pixel icon frame containing only transparent data.
* **Note:** This file is functionally invisible and has no visual impact on the website or browser tab.
